Hello everyone,

I am Wanja Njung'e, a Kenyan based in Nairobi. I'm also a first time Outreachy applicant. Being a self taught developer I have greatly benefited from Open Source products as well as well written technical documentation. I cannot wait to also make it easier for others to navigate a product aided by precise documentation.

When I am not on my screen I always have a hook and yarn in hand. I make all sorts of cute crocheted beanies, cardigans and bikinis for my loved ones. I am lucky because I get free muses to practice on and even when they are ill-fitting we can laugh it off as I learn what not to do next time.

I enjoy reading a lot too though lately I'd been having reader's block and randomly picked up a Chimamanda book and now I'm 3 books in regretting why I'd never indulged her before lol.

Outreachy has presented this exciting challenge, collaborating, connecting with other like minded individuals and the opportunity to be a part of the open source community. Time to dig in!
